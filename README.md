# go-redis

The go-redis is a database framework for implementing a Redis compatible database server easily.

## What is the go-redis?

The go-redis handles RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol) and interprets any commands based on the RESP so that all developers can develop Redis compatible servers easily.

Because the go-redis is a compatible framework based on RESP and Redis command specifications, all developers can connect to a compatible server based on the go-redis using general client drivers for Redis.
